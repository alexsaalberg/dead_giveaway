/**
* The &lt;code&gt; AbstractClient &lt;/code&gt; contains all the
* methods necessary to set up the client side of a client-server
* architecture.  When a client is thus connected to the
* server, the two programs can then exchange &lt;code&gt; Object &lt;/code&gt;
* instances.&lt;p&gt;
*
* Method &lt;code&gt; handleMessageFromServer &lt;/code&gt; must be defined by
* a concrete subclass. Several other hook methods may also be
* overriden.&lt;p&gt;
*
* Several public service methods are provided to
* application that use this framework.&lt;p&gt;
*
* The modifications made to this class in version 2.2 are:
* &lt;ul&gt;
* &lt;li&gt; Method &lt;code&gt;sendToServer()&lt;/code&gt; is not
* declared final anymore. This allows user of the
* framework to override it, perhaps to perform some
* filtering before sending the message to the server.
* However, any overriden version of this method
* should include a call to the original one.
* &lt;li&gt; A test is made before calling the
* &lt;code&gt;handleMessageFromServer&lt;/code&gt; method such that
* when  &lt;code&gt;closeConnection&lt;/code&gt; returns, it
* is garanteed that no new messages will be handled.
* &lt;/ul&gt;
* The modifications made to this class in version 2.31 are:
* &lt;ul&gt;
* &lt;li&gt; The &lt;code&gt;run()&lt;/code&gt; method now calls the &lt;code&gt;connectionException&lt;/code&gt; 
* callback when an object of unknown class is received from the input stream
* or when the message handler throw a &lt;code&gt;RuntimeException&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;li&gt; The &lt;code&gt;connectionClosed&lt;/code&gt; callback might be called after
* &lt;code&gt;connectionException&lt;/code&gt; if the exception causes the end of te thread.
* &lt;li&gt; The &lt;code&gt;clientReader&lt;/code&gt; reference is set to &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;
* earlier in &lt;code&gt;run()&lt;/code&gt; method.
* &lt;li&gt; The call to &lt;code&gt;connectionClosed&lt;/code&gt; has been moved from
* &lt;code&gt;closeConnection&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;run&lt;/code&gt; method to garantee
* that connection is really closed when this callback is called.
* &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;

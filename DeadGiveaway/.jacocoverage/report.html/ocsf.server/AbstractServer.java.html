/**
* The &lt;code&gt; AbstractServer &lt;/code&gt; class maintains a thread that waits
* for connection attempts from clients. When a connection attempt occurs
* it creates a new &lt;code&gt; ConnectionToClient &lt;/code&gt; instance which
* runs as a thread. When a client is thus connected to the
* server, the two programs can then exchange &lt;code&gt; Object &lt;/code&gt;
* instances.&lt;p&gt;
*
* Method &lt;code&gt; handleMessageFromClient &lt;/code&gt; must be defined by
* a concrete subclass. Several other hook methods may also be
* overriden.&lt;p&gt;
*
* Several public service methods are provided to applications that use
* this framework, and several hook methods are also available&lt;p&gt;
*
* The modifications made to this class in version 2.2 are:
* &lt;ul&gt;
* &lt;li&gt; The synchronization of the &lt;code&gt;close()&lt;/code&gt; method
* is now limited to the client threads closing sequence. The
* call to &lt;code&gt;serverClosed()&lt;/code&gt; is outside the synchronized
* block and is preceeded by a join that garantees that
* &lt;code&gt;serverStopped()&lt;/code&gt; is always called before.
* &lt;li&gt; Method &lt;code&gt;isClosed()&lt;/code&gt; has been added.
* &lt;li&gt; When a client is accepted, the corresponding
* connection thread will be created only if the server
* has not been stopped.
* &lt;/ul&gt;
* The modifications made to this class in version 2.3 are:
* &lt;ul&gt;
* &lt;li&gt; An instance variable refering to the current connection
* factory. Refer to null value by default, in this case regular
* &lt;code&gt;ConnectionToClient&lt;/code&gt; instances are created as in the
* previous versions. 
* &lt;li&gt; Method &lt;code&gt;setConnectionFactory()&lt;/code&gt; has been added.
* &lt;li&gt; In the run method, a call to the connection factory
* is made if such a factory is available.  
* &lt;li&gt; Method &lt;code&gt;handleMessageFromClient&lt;/code&gt; is not always
* called depending on the value returned by the 
* &lt;code&gt;handleMessageFromClient&lt;/code&gt; of the &lt;code&gt;ConnectionToClient&lt;/code&gt;
* class.
* &lt;li&gt; The &lt;code&gt;clientException&lt;/code&gt; method is still the one called when
* an exception is thrown when handling the connection with one client. However
* &lt;code&gt;ClassNotFoundException&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;RuntimeException&lt;/code&gt; instances
* can now be received.  
* &lt;li&gt; The call to &lt;code&gt;serverStopped()&lt;/code&gt; has been moved in 
* the &lt;code&gt;run&lt;/code&gt; method.
* &lt;li&gt; Method &lt;code&gt;isListening()&lt;/code&gt; has been modified.
* &lt;li&gt; Instance variable &lt;code&gt;readToStop&lt;/code&gt; is now initialized to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
